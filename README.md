React (Frontend)

Used React to build a responsive, modern user interface.

Managed state with useState and lifecycle with useEffect.

Components are modular: AuthPage handles login/register, ChatPage handles real-time messaging.

Styling is inline and flexible, demonstrating dynamic UI design.

Node.js + Express (Backend)

Built a RESTful API for authentication.

Routes are modular (authRoutes.js) to keep code organized.

Error handling is implemented to provide meaningful responses.

Middleware like cors and express.json() ensures smooth frontend-backend communication.

MongoDB + Mongoose (Database)

Used MongoDB to store users.

Schema design with Mongoose enforces validation (unique email, username).

Demonstrates knowledge of NoSQL databases and how to structure data for real applications.

Authentication & Security

Passwords hashed using bcryptjs before storing in the database.

Authentication endpoints validate input and prevent duplicate registrations.

Demonstrates secure handling of user credentials in real-world apps.

Socket.IO (Real-Time Communication)

Implemented WebSockets for real-time messaging.

Users can send messages instantly to all connected clients without page reloads.

Shows understanding of real-time architecture and client-server communication.

Full-Stack Integration

Frontend communicates with backend via Axios HTTP requests.

Backend handles authentication, hashing, and sending JSON responses.

Real-time chat bypasses HTTP using Socket.IO, combining REST and WebSocket protocols in one app.

Development Workflow

Used Git & GitHub for version control, demonstrating collaborative development skills.

Proper .gitignore setup to exclude node_modules and sensitive files.

Used nodemon for backend development for faster iteration.
